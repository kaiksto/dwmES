=====

dwm Environment Scripts is a bundle of custom tailored scripts
for nice and smooth dwm workflow.
Of course it doesn't mean that it's the only window manager you
can use them with, but this may require some extra changes.

Current list of scripts:

* dbdb - dmenu based directory browser, made for fast and easy navigation in terminal.
* gtfo - x's window killer. Aim and kill!
